Stay classy with an object-oriented approach to Mongoid denormalization.

Unlike other Mongoid denormalization gems, `Mongoid::ClassyDenorm` is relatively on light meta-programming "magic",
and does not auto-define the models or relations used to contain the denormalized data. This is by design, so
that the implementer may employ custom techniques like polymorphism. Therefore, it is implementer must follow the below
instructions carefully.


Mongoid::ClassyDenorm is inspired by [@dzello](https://github.com/dzello)'s fantastic [Mongoid::Alize](https://github.com/dzello/mongoid_alize) gem.


### Usage

* **Step 1)** Start with two "normalized" models, one (the *"Source"*) which you which you wish to denormalize to another (the *"Target"*).

* **Step 2)** Create an embedded model to contain your denormalized data (the *"Container"*):
    * The *Container* SHOULD have a subset of the fields of the *Source*; ensure the field names and types are identical.
    * The *Container* MUST be `embedded_in` the *Target*.
    * The *Container* MUST `belongs_to` the *Source*.
    * It is possible (but not recommended) for the *Container* to be a non-embedded model.

* **Step 3)** Use **one** of the following `classy_denorm` macro patterns to setup callbacks:

   * In your *Target* model, you can use "bi-directional" or `:pull` style:

   ```ruby
   # Bi-directional push/pull sync
   classy_denorm <source_relation>, <container_relation>

   # One-way sync via pull
   classy_denorm <source_relation>, <container_relation>, only: :pull
   ```

   * **OR** in your *Source* model, you can use `:push` style:

   ```ruby
   # One-way sync via push
   classy_denorm <target_relation>, <container_relation>, only: :push
   ```


### Worked Example

* In this example, we wish to denormalize `Appointment` (the *source*) to `Customer` (the *target*), using `DenormAppointment` as the *container*.

```ruby
class Appointment                  # the Source
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :date,    type: Time
  field :status,  type: Symbol
  field :reason,  type: String
  # other fields...

  belongs_to :customer
end

class Customer                     # the "Target"
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::ClassyDenorm

  field :name,  type: String

  # REQUIRED: Define the relation you wish to denormalize
  has_many :appointments

  # REQUIRED: Define the embedded relation to the denormalization target
  embeds_many :denorm_appointments do

     # Optional: adding extensions to denormalized data (via a block) can be especially useful
     # to reduce query traffic. See: http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/relations.html
     def late_count
       @target.select{ |a| a.late? }.size
     end
  end

  # REQUIRED: Call the `classy_denorm` macro
  classy_denorm :appointments, :denorm_appointments
end

class DenormAppointment            # the "Container"
  include Mongoid::Document

  # REQUIRED: define an `embedded_in` to the "Target"
  embedded_in :customer

  # REQUIRED: Define a `has_one` relation to the "Source"
  belong_to :appointment

  # EmbeddedDenorm will automatically detect the overlapping fields
  # by name, and set only those ones
  field :date,    type: Time
  field :status,  type: Symbol

  # You may define custom methods on your denormalized objects. Consider using a mixin
  # to support the same methods on both the original and denormalized models.
  def late?
    status == :late
  end
end

# Tying it all together

customer    = Customer.create
appointment = Appointment.create(date: Date.today, status: :late, reason: "Apply for fish license")

# Create
customer.appointments << appointment      # auto-creates DenormAppointment record
d_appointment = customer.reload.denorm_appointments.first
d_appointment.appointment == appointment  #=> true
d_appointment.late?                       #=> true
customer.denorm_appointments.late_count   #=> 1

# Update
appointment.update_attributes(status: :on_time)   # auto-updates DenormAppointment record
customer.reload.denorm_appointments.first.late?   #=> false

# Destroy
customer.appointments.clear               # auto-destroys DenormAppointment record
customer.reload.denorm_appointments       #=> []
```


### Comparison with Mongoid::Alize

[Mongoid::Alize](https://github.com/dzello/mongoid_alize) supports the full gamut of denormalization methods (bidirectional/push/pull).
However, Alize persists denormalized data as a `Hash` (or an `Array` of `Hash`es). This has the following drawbacks:

* One cannot code methods into the denormalized `Hash` objects as if they were regular models.

* Mongoid's default demongoization is used on the denormalized Hash, which does not preserve `DateTime` vs. `Date`, `String` vs. `Symbol`, etc. due to ambiguities between mapping MongoDB types to Ruby types [(see here)](https://github.com/dzello/mongoid_alize/issues/18).

* Parts of the Alize gem code are in practice duplicating Mongoid's built-in embedded document functionality. This adds extra complexity and testing overhead to the gem.

While I contributed several PRs to Aliz√©, ultimately I felt that a clean-slate approach was warranted to use embedded documents.
